        Geralt is a witcher. Shortly after being born, Geralt's mother, Visenna,
        gives him away to undergo training and, eventually, become a witcher at
        Kaer Morhen â€“ the stronghold of the witchers. Geralt survives mutations
        during the Trial of the Grasses, thanks to which he gains various
        witcher traits: high resistance to injury, poison, and diseases, as well
        as slowed aging, but also infertility; all witchers are infertile. He
        resists the "changes" brought on by the Trial of Grasses better than
        most. This encourages his makers to perform even more dangerous
        experimental procedures on him, making him lose all body pigmentation.
        Because of his pale skin and white hair, he is also known in the Elder
        Speech as "Gwynbleidd", the White Wolf. From the arduous training of
        Witchers, he becomes a master swordfighter and learns how to use the
        Signs, simple spells used by the witchers. Despite his name, Geralt does
        not come from Rivia (although he learns how to mimic a Rivian accent and
        is later knighted for services to the queen of Rivia): young witchers
        are encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir, to
        make their names sound more trustworthy. He claims that his first choice
        was Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde, but this was dismissed by
        Vesemir as silly and pretentious.
