        Eredin is a figure that leads a horde of ghastly riders across the sky.
        In The Swallow's Tower, he and Avallac'h lure Ciri to the tower, which
        led to her imprisonment in the world belonging to Aen Elle. There, the
        duo tried to force her to beget a child with the king of the Aen Elle
        elves to harness her powers. Eredin ruined the plan by killing the king.
        Ciri managed to escape with the help of unicorns, but not before
        learning that elves have massacred humans on the Aen Elle world.
