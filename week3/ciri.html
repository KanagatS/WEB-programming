        Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, known as Ciri, the Lady of Time and Space
        and princess of Cintra, is one of the main characters of the Witcher
        saga, around whom much of the plot is centered. She is the lion cub of
        Cintra, daughter of Pavetta and Duny (also known as the Urcheon of
        Erlenwald) and granddaughter of Queen Calanthe. She is also Geralt's
        destiny and adopted daughter. Ciri is a descendant of Lara Dorren and
        has the Elder blood which gives her access to powers that allow her to
        cross space and time. Ciri was trained under the watchful eyes of
        Geralt, CoÃ«n, Vesemir, Lambert, Eskel, and Triss while at Kaer Morhen
        and became talented with a sword. Later, she trained as a sorceress
        while living with Yennefer at Ellander. After the Thanedd coup, Ciri
        became separated from Geralt, created an unstable portal, and going
        through it found herself in the Korath desert. After her time in the
        desert, she joined a gang called the Rats, but then got herself captured
        by a bounty hunter named Leo Bonhart and was forced to fight in an
        arena. She later escaped and fled to the world of Aen Elle. During her
        time with the Aen Elle, she was going to be forced to procreate with the
        King, although she was able to avoid this. She later escaped from that
        world and after traveling through time was reunited with Geralt and Yen.
        She travelled with them for a few months before their untimely deaths.
        Her sword named Zireael is a 200 year old gwyhyr, a very expensive and
        precious sword regarded as the best in the world, forged by the gnomes
        of Tir Tochair. It was given to her as a gift by Esterhazy, the armorer
        and swordsmith in the town of Fano. At the end of the books, after
        Geralt and Yennefer's deaths, Ciri finds herself in the world of Camelot
        where she meets young Galahad, one of King Arthur's knights, with whom
        she supposedly falls in love.
