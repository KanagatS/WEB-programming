      <h3>
        This is my 3rd time going through the Wild Hunt, but for some reason now
        it seems to me that I went through it for the last time. After reading
        the entire book saga and going through the first 2 parts, the
        impressions of the finale of the story about the White Wolf are
        completely different. A lot of emotions intertwined into one: some
        characters are happy, others are sad, you sit with a bewildered happy
        smile on your face, saying: “Is that it? Is there really nothing else?
        No, it can not be". But in the end, when you return to places where you
        have already been, with which your memories are connected, where
        emotions are seething, and you don’t see ... anyone and nothing, just
        emptiness - at such moments, such a wave of longing will come over you
        that you want corny to load the last save and again be close to those
        characters who were once here. It was damn sad for me to return to Kaer
        Morhen after the adventures of the game, to see that it was empty and
        there was not a single soul in it, I remembered the last conversation
        between Geralt and Eskel and realized that the witchers of the School of
        the Wolf would never return to their home ... from -due to the death of
        my mentor, my father, I realized that they have gone to different parts
        of the world and may never meet again ... we will never meet to know
        about it.
