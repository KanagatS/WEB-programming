        Sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg (nicknamed Yen or Yenna) first appeared
        in the collection of short stories, The Last Wish, featuring in both
        "The Last Wish" short story and "The Voice of Reason" frame story. She
        went on to appear in numerous other Witcher stories and is one of the
        main characters of the Witcher saga. Yennefer is described as
        possessive. She becomes one of Geralt's lovers although their
        relationship is difficult and full of drama. Both Geralt and Yennefer
        are sterile, which adds another level of tragedy to the mix. Yennefer
        has a hard time accepting the fact and tries various methods of
        restoring her fertility. Yennefer ends up becoming a mother to Ciri
        while teaching her and watching over her while she was at Ellander.
        Yennefer was born on Belleteyn of the year 1173. She lived in the
        capital city of Aedirn, Vengerberg. She is one of the most powerful
        mages on the continent and is surpassed by only a handful. She is the
        youngest member of the Council of Sorcerers and later she became a
        member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. During the Battle of Sodden Hill she
        was blinded by Fringilla Vigo, a Nilfgaardian sorceress. Her sight was
        magically restored. Yennefer was famous for her beauty, even though
        during the events of The Swallow's Tower, she was 94 years old. She
        always dressed in black and white clothing. She used lilac and
        gooseberry perfumes. She had violet eyes and raven black hair. Before
        becoming a sorceress, she was a hunchback, but had her deformities fixed
        by Tissaia de Vries while being an apprentice although Geralt is able to
        see the subtle clues that let him figure out the truth. At the end of
        the books, Yennefer ends up dying while trying to heal Geralt, after
        losing all her energy.
