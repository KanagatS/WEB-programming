        <h2>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</h2>
        <p>
          The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private
          land-grant research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
          Established in 1861, MIT has since played a key role in the
          development of modern technology and science, ranking among the top
          academic institutions in the world.<br /><br />
          Founded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United
          States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and
          stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering.
          The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile
          alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major
          off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates
          Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated
          laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.<br /><br />
          As of December 2021, 98 Nobel laureates, 26 Turing Award winners, and
          8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT as alumni, faculty
          members, or researchers. In addition, 58 National Medal of Science
          recipients, 29 National Medals of Technology and Innovation
          recipients, 50 MacArthur Fellows, 80 Marshall Scholars, 41 astronauts,
          16 Chief Scientists of the US Air Force, and numerous heads of states
          have been affiliated with MIT. The institute also has a strong
          entrepreneurial culture and MIT alumni have founded or co-founded many
          notable companies. MIT is a member of the Association of American
          Universities and has received more Sloan Research Fellowships than any
          other university in North America.

        <h2>University of Cambridge</h2>
        <p>
          The University of Cambridge is a collegiate research university in
          Cambridge, United Kingdom. Founded in 1209 and granted a royal charter
          by Henry III in 1231, Cambridge is the world's third oldest surviving
          university and one of its most prestigious, currently ranked, along
          with Stanford University, third best in the world by QS World
          University Rankings. <br /><br />
          Over its eight century existence, Cambridge alumni and faculty have
          won 121 Nobel Prizes, the most of any university in the world. Among
          the university's most notable alumni are 11 Fields Medalists, seven
          Turing Award winners, 47 heads of state, 14 British prime ministers,
          194 Olympic medal-winning athletes, and some of world history's most
          transformational and iconic figures across disciplines, including
          Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver Cromwell, Charles Darwin, Rajiv
          Gandhi, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John Milton, Vladimir
          Nabokov, Isaac Newton, Alan Turing, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig
          Wittgenstein, and others.<br /><br />
          The University of Cambridge's 13th-century founding was largely
          inspired by an association of scholars then who fled the University of
          Oxford for Cambridge following the suspendium clericorium in a dispute
          with local townspeople. The two ancient English universities, though
          sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are
          often jointly referred to as Oxbridge.

        <h2>Stanford University</h2>
        <p>
          Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University, is
          a private research university in Stanford, California. The campus
          occupies 8,180 acres (3,310 hectares), among the largest in the United
          States, and enrolls over 17,000 students. Stanford is ranked among the
          top universities in the world.<br /><br />
          Stanford was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of
          their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever
          at age 15 the previous year. Leland Stanford was a U.S. senator and
          former governor of California who made his fortune as a railroad
          tycoon. The school admitted its first students on October 1, 1891, as
          a coeducational and non-denominational institution. Stanford
          University struggled financially after the death of Leland Stanford in
          1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San
          Francisco earthquake. Following World War II, provost Frederick Terman
          supported faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build
          self-sufficient local industry in what would later be known as Silicon
          Valley. <br /><br />
          The university is organized around seven schools on the same campus:
          three schools consisting of 40 academic departments at the
          undergraduate level as well as four professional schools that focus on
          graduate programs in law, medicine, education, and business. The
          university also houses the public policy think tank, the Hoover
          Institution.

        <h2>University of Oxford</h2>
        <p>
          The University of Oxford is a collegiate research university in
          Oxford, England. There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,
          making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the
          world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew
          rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending
          the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford
          townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where
          they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two
          English ancient universities share many common features and are
          jointly referred to as Oxbridge. Oxford is ranked among the most
          prestigious universities in the world, currently being ranked 2nd best
          in the world and best in Europe by QS World University Rankings.<br /><br />
          The university is made up of thirty-nine semi-autonomous constituent
          colleges, six permanent private halls, and a range of academic
          departments which are organised into four divisions. All the colleges
          are self-governing institutions within the university, each
          controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and
          activities. All students are members of a college. It does not have a
          main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout
          the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of
          lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars,
          laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the
          central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is
          provided predominantly centrally.

        <h2>Harvard University</h2>
        <p>
          Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in
          Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named
          for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is
          the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States and one
          of the most prestigious and highly rated in the world.<br /><br />
          The university is composed of ten academic faculties plus Harvard
          Radcliffe Institute. Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of
          undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties
          offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard
          has three main campuses: the 209-acre Cambridge campus centered on
          Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in
          the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's
          Longwood Medical Area. Harvard's endowment is valued at $53.2 billion,
          making it the wealthiest academic institution in the world. Endowment
          income enables the undergraduate college to admit students regardless
          of financial need and provide generous financial aid with no loans.
          Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system,
          comprising 79 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.

        <h2>California Institute of Technology</h2>
        <p>
          The California Institute of Technology (branded as Caltech) is a
          private research university in Pasadena, California. The university is
          known for its strength in science and engineering, and is among a
          small group of institutes of technology in the United States which is
          primarily devoted to the instruction of pure and applied sciences.
          Caltech is ranked among the best academic institutions in the world
          and is among the most selective in the U.S.<br /><br />
          The institution was founded as a preparatory and vocational school by
          Amos G. Throop in 1891 and began attracting influential scientists
          such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews
          Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory
          schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910 and the college assumed
          its present name in 1920. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the
          Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's
          Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and
          operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von
          Kármán.

        <h2>Imperial College London</h2>
        <p>
          Imperial College London (formally Imperial College of Science,
          Technology and Medicine) is a public research university in London,
          United Kingdom. Its history began with Prince Albert, consort of Queen
          Victoria, who developed his vision for a cultural area that included
          the Royal Albert Hall, Victoria & Albert Museum, Natural History
          Museum and royal colleges. In 1907, Imperial College was established
          by a royal charter, which unified the Royal College of Science, Royal
          School of Mines, and City and Guilds of London Institute. In 1988, the
          Imperial College School of Medicine was formed by merging with St
          Mary's Hospital Medical School. In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II opened the
          Imperial College Business School. <br /><br />
          Imperial focuses exclusively on science, technology, medicine, and
          business. The main campus is located in South Kensington, and there is
          an innovation campus in White City. Facilities also include teaching
          hospitals throughout London, which form an academic health science
          centre with Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. Imperial joined the
          University of London in 1908, becoming an independent university in
          2007. Imperial has a highly international community, with 59% of
          students from outside the UK and 140 countries represented on campus.

          University College London, which operates as UCL, is a public research
          university in London, United Kingdom. It is a member institution of
          the federal University of London, and is the second-largest university
          in the United Kingdom by total enrolment and the largest by
          postgraduate enrolment.<br /><br />
          Established in 1826, as London University, by founders inspired by the
          radical ideas of Jeremy Bentham, UCL was the first university
          institution to be established in London, and the first in England to
          be entirely secular and to admit students regardless of their
          religion. UCL also makes contested claims to being the third-oldest
          university in England and the first to admit women. In 1836, UCL
          became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London,
          which was granted a royal charter in the same year. It has grown
          through mergers, including with the Institute of Ophthalmology (in
          1995), the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital
          Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the

        <h2>Peking University</h2>
        <p>
          Peking University (PKU; Chinese: 北京大学; lit. 'University of
          Beijing'; colloquially known as Beida (北大)) is a public research
          university in Beijing, China. The university is funded by the Ministry
          of Education. <br /><br />
          Peking University was established as the Imperial University of Peking
          in 1898 when it received its royal charter by the Guangxu Emperor. A
          successor of the older Guozijian Imperial College, the university's
          romanized name 'Peking' retains the older transliteration of 'Beijing'
          that has been superseded in most other contexts. Perennially ranked as
          one of the top academic institutions in China and the world, as of
          2021 Peking University was ranked 16th globally and 1st in the
          Asia-Pacific & emerging countries by Times Higher Education, while as
          of 2022 it was ranked 12th globally and 1st in China by QS World
          University Rankings.<br /><br />
          Throughout its history, Peking University has had an important role
          "at the center of major intellectual movements" in China. Abolished of
          its status as a royal institution after the fall of the Qing dynasty
          and the Xinhai Revolution; from the early 1920s, the university became
          a center for China's emerging, progressive, and republican movements.
