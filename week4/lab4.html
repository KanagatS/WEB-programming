            Skyscraper Burj Khalifa Dubai is famous primarily for its
            skyscrapers and futuristic architectural structures. One of the most
            famous buildings is the Burj Khalifa skyscraper, by the way, the
            highest in the world (828 meters). From the observation deck on the
            124th floor (at a height of 472 meters) offers a magnificent view of
            the city.

          <h2>
            In Dubai mall, the most unusual thing is the oceanarium inside it.
            More than 33,000 marine animals and fish live here! You can see this
            beauty by walking along the tunnel, laid through the entire length
            of the aquarium. The review is fantastic - 270 degrees! And you can
            take pictures as much as you want.
          </h2>

          <h2>
            Even in the prohibitively expensive Dubai, you can find free
            entertainment. One of the most interesting places that you can see
            for $0 is the dancing and singing fountain next to the Burj Khalifa
            skyscraper. Every evening, the jets of the fountain are illuminated
            by lights, accompanied by the best classical, national and
            contemporary music.
          </h2>

          <h2>
            Wild Wadi Waterpark. The perfect place for thrill seekers. There are
            as many as 30 non-banal attractions. For the most daring - dizzying
            slides with the effect of free fall and pools with the effect of a
            storm. More calm, but no less interesting slides in the water park,
            of course, also exist.
